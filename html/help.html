            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <span
              >Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and
              built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web
              development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</span
            >

            <span
              >Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly
              effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
              maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of
              kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
              intuitive, visual interface.</span

            <span
              >It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational
              exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While

                        When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board.
                        This board represents your project and contains four
                        default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                        feedback” and "Done".</span

                        >In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                        projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New
                        contact", and fill in the required information. Once
                        added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they
                        can interact with the tasks on the board.</span

                      <span>
                        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start
                        adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
                        the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a
                        new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
                        task name, description, due date, assignees,
                        etc.</span

                      <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                      <span
                        >Once a task is completed, you can either move it to
                        the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                        permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise
                        caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                        irreversible. <br />

                        Remember that using Join effectively requires
                        consistent updates from you and your team to ensure
                        the board reflects the current state of your project.
